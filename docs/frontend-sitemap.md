## Technical Considerations

### Route Guards

- Role-based access for `/dashboard/admin/*` routes
- KYC verification for financial routes

### Data Preloading
- Server-side rendering for public routes
- Client-side fetching with React Query for dashboard
- Optimistic updates for user actions

### SEO Requirements
- Static generation for public pages
- Dynamic meta tags for content pages
- Sitemap generation for search engines

### Performance Targets
- LCP < 2.5s for all routes
- FID < 100ms
- CLS < 0.1
- Code splitting per route

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve sitemap with stakeholders
2. Create route scaffolding for Phase 1 routes
3. Implement navigation components
4. Set up route guards and middleware
