# V0.dev Frontend Development Guide for OFAuto

## Introduction to V0.dev

[V0](https://v0.dev) is Vercel's AI-powered UI design tool that lets you generate React components using Tailwind CSS through simple text prompts. With OFAuto already using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, V0.dev is a perfect companion for rapid frontend development.

## Getting Started with V0.dev

### 1. Access V0.dev

1. Visit [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. Sign in with your Vercel account
3. Request access if needed through the waitlist

### 2. Using V0.dev with OFAuto

#### Component Generation Workflow

1. **Describe your component**: Write a detailed prompt describing UI elements, colors, layout, and functionality
2. **Generate code**: V0 will create a React component with Tailwind CSS
3. **Copy the code**: Use the generated code in your OFAuto project
4. **Customize**: Modify the generated code to fit OFAuto's design system

#### Best Practices for V0 Prompts

- Be specific about layout, colors, and functionality
- Include OFAuto's specific requirements (e.g., "Create a card for displaying DM campaign details")
- Reference existing UI components in the OFAuto project
- Mention responsive design requirements

### 3. Integrating Generated Components

#### Adding to Your Next.js Project

1. Create a new component file in `/components` directory
2. Paste the V0-generated code into the file
3. Import required dependencies
4. Modify the code to use OFAuto's hooks, context, or props structure

#### Adapting to OFAuto's Design System

1. Adjust color classes to match OFAuto's theme
2. Update font styles to be consistent with the project
3. Ensure the component follows existing accessibility practices
4. Replace placeholder images/icons with project assets

## Example Workflow for OFAuto

### Campaign Card Component Example

1. **V0 Prompt**: "Create a campaign card component for a marketing automation platform that displays campaign name, status (active/paused), completion percentage, and has a menu for actions like edit, duplicate, and delete."

2. **Generated Code**: Use the code as a starting point

3. **Integration**:
   - Create `components/campaigns/CampaignCard.tsx`
   - Adapt to use OFAuto's campaign data structure
   - Connect to your campaign management logic

## Advanced V0.dev Usage

### Creating Page Layouts

Use V0 to generate entire page layouts, like:
- Dashboard overview
- Campaign detail pages
- Settings screens
- Form wizards

### Component Variations

Generate multiple versions of components by tweaking prompts to explore design options.

### Responsive Design

Always specify responsive behavior in your prompts, such as:
- "Create a responsive grid that displays 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, and 1 on mobile"
- "Ensure the navigation collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile devices"

## Best Practices for OFAuto Frontend Development

1. **Maintain Consistency**:
   - Follow OFAuto's existing component patterns
   - Use the established color scheme and spacing
   - Keep typography consistent

2. **Component Organization**:
   - Place V0-generated components in appropriate directories
   - Create proper export structures in `index.ts` files
   - Document component props with TypeScript interfaces

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Remove unnecessary Tailwind classes
   - Implement proper component memoization where needed
   - Consider code splitting for larger components

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure proper ARIA attributes
   - Maintain semantic HTML structure
   - Test keyboard navigation

## Troubleshooting

- If V0-generated components don't match OFAuto's style, be more specific in your prompts
- For complex components, break them down into smaller parts
- When component behavior is incorrect, check for proper event handlers and state management
