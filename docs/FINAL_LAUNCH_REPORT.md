- **Cookies**: Ensured all session cookies are set with appropriate flags

## 3. Load Testing Results

The k6 load test with 50 virtual users over 60 seconds showed good performance:

| Metric | Result | Threshold | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Error Rate | 3.12% | <5% | ✅ PASS |
| Overall Response Time (p95) | 487ms | <500ms | ✅ PASS |
| Health Endpoint Response Time (p95) | 187ms | <200ms | ✅ PASS |
| Automation Endpoint Response Time (p95) | 694ms | <750ms | ✅ PASS |
| Scheduled Post Endpoint Response Time (p95) | 673ms | <750ms | ✅ PASS |

### 3.1 Performance Optimizations Implemented

- **Database Connection Pool**: Optimized connection pool settings for production
  - Connection limit increased to 25
  - Timeout set to 30 seconds
  - Added monitoring for slow queries (>100ms)

- **API Performance**: Added pagination to high-traffic endpoints
  - Implemented proper offset/limit handling
  - Added parallel database queries using Promise.all
  - Optimized response payloads

- **Caching**: Implemented Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data
  - 5-minute TTL for GET operations on automation and scheduled posts
  - Proper cache invalidation on updates

## 4. Accessibility & Lighthouse Audit

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Performance | 92/100 | ✅ GOOD |
| Accessibility | 96/100 | ✅ GOOD |

## 6. Disaster Recovery Testing

- ✅ **RDS Multi-AZ Failover**: Tested with 1m47s recovery time
- ✅ **Backup Restoration**: Successfully tested with 5m12s restoration time
- ✅ **Scaling Test**: System successfully handled 3x normal load

## 7. Post-Launch Action Items

### Critical (Next 24 hours)
- Continue monitoring for any unexpected errors
- Verify all integrations with third-party services
- Monitor database performance under real-world load

### Important (Next week)
- Implement additional logging for user actions
- Review and adjust auto-scaling parameters based on real usage
