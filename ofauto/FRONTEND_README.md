# OFAuto Frontend Implementation

This document provides an overview of the frontend implementation for the OFAuto platform. The UI is built with Next.js 13+ using the App Router, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and tRPC for type-safe API interactions.

## Overview

The frontend is organized around a comprehensive dashboard that provides access to multiple platform features:

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Main dashboard with key metrics and quick actions
2. **Connected Accounts**: Platform connections to Patreon, Ko-fi, Fansly, OnlyFans
3. **Marketing & Outreach**: Tools for scheduling posts, automated messaging, and campaign management
4. **Social Media Integration**: Connect and manage social media platforms
5. **Geo-Spoofing & Proxy**: Configure regional settings and proxy options
6. **Financial Performance**: Track revenue, transactions, and ROI
7. **Developer Guide**: Documentation for extending the platform

## Key Components

### Dashboard Layout

The dashboard is built around a tab-based interface that allows users to navigate between different sections while maintaining a consistent layout. The main dashboard page is located in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

### Platform Connection Components

#### ConnectedAccountsSection

Located in `src/components/dashboard/ConnectedAccountsSection.tsx`, this component:
- Displays connection status for all supported monetization platforms
- Provides buttons to connect, update, or disconnect platforms
- Shows last updated timestamps for each connection

#### ConnectPlatformModal

Located in `src/components/dashboard/ConnectPlatformModal.tsx`, this component:
- Provides different connection forms based on platform type
- Handles form validation using Zod schemas
- Supports different authentication methods:
  - OAuth for platforms like Patreon
  - API key for platforms like Ko-fi
  - Username/password for platforms like Fansly and OnlyFans

### Feature-Specific Components

#### MarketingOutreachSection

Located in `src/components/dashboard/MarketingOutreachSection.tsx`, this component:
- Enables content scheduling across platforms
- Provides automated messaging templates and controls
- Manages marketing campaigns and performance tracking

#### SocialMediaIntegrationSection

Located in `src/components/dashboard/SocialMediaIntegrationSection.tsx`, this component:
- Manages connections to social media platforms
- Controls cross-posting settings
- Handles social media API keys and authentication

#### GeoSpoofingSection

Located in `src/components/dashboard/GeoSpoofingSection.tsx`, this component:
- Controls proxy settings and location spoofing
- Manages security settings for connections
- Tracks proxy performance metrics

#### FinancialPerformanceSection

Located in `src/components/dashboard/FinancialPerformanceSection.tsx`, this component:
- Displays revenue metrics across platforms
- Shows transaction history
- Provides ROI tracking for marketing campaigns
- Allows comparisons between platforms

### Developer Guide

The `DeveloperGuide` component in `src/components/dashboard/DeveloperGuide.tsx` provides comprehensive documentation for developers who want to extend the platform with new integrations.

## Authentication & Security

- User authentication is handled through Clerk
- Platform credentials are encrypted before storage
- Secure OAuth flows for supported platforms
- Protected routes and procedures using tRPC

## Backend Communication

Backend communication is handled through tRPC procedures defined in the router files:

- `src/lib/trpc/routers/platformConnections.ts` - Handles platform connection operations
- Other routers for specific features

## Adding New Platforms

To add support for a new platform:

1. Update the platform type schema in `platformConnections.ts`
2. Create appropriate input validation schemas
3. Add tRPC procedures for connecting/disconnecting the platform
4. Update the UI components to include the new platform
5. Implement any platform-specific API clients

For detailed instructions, refer to the Developer Guide section in the dashboard.

## Environment Variables

The application requires several environment variables:

- `PLATFORM_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` - 64-character hex key for credential encryption
- Platform-specific API keys and secrets (varies by platform)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - App URL for OAuth callbacks

## UI Framework

The UI is built using Shadcn/UI components which provide a consistent design system:

- Cards for content grouping
- Forms for user input
- Dialogs for modals
- Tables for data display
- Tabs for section navigation

## Responsive Design

All components are built with responsive design in mind:

- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive grids using Tailwind's grid system
- Appropriate spacing and sizing across devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for enhancement:

1. Advanced analytics visualizations
2. Additional platform integrations
3. Enhanced automation capabilities
4. More detailed financial reporting
5. Multi-user access controls

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- Platform connection issues: Check API keys and credentials
- OAuth flow failures: Verify callback URLs and permissions
- UI rendering issues: Clear cache and refresh
- Type errors: Ensure tRPC types are up to date
