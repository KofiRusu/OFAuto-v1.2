## üß™ What to Test

Please focus your testing on these key areas:

### Platform Connections
- Connect at least one platform (Patreon, Instagram, etc.)
- Verify connection status is displayed correctly
- Test disconnecting and reconnecting

### Content Automation
- Create a scheduled post
- Trigger an auto-DM workflow
- Test content creation with different settings (public/PPV/etc.)

### Media Upload
- Test uploading from Google Drive
- Try different media types (images/videos)
- Verify media appears correctly in posts

### Payments
- Use Stripe test cards to simulate payments
  - Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (successful payment)
  - Test card: `4000 0000 0000 9995` (declined payment)
- Verify webhook functionality by checking server logs
