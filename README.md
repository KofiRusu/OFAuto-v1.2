## Onboarding & Contracts

OFAuto includes a comprehensive e-signature contract system to facilitate legal agreements between managers and models during onboarding.

### Contract Model

The Contract model enables legal agreements between managers and models:

```prisma
model Contract {
  id                  String          @id @default(uuid())
  modelId             String          // ID of model who needs to sign
  managerId           String          // ID of manager who created the contract
  documentUrl         String          // URL to the contract document
  status              ContractStatus  @default(PENDING)
  signedAt            DateTime?       // Timestamp when contract was signed
  createdAt           DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt           DateTime        @updatedAt
  
  model               User            @relation("ModelContracts", fields: [modelId], references: [id])
  manager             User            @relation("ManagerContracts", fields: [managerId], references: [id])
  
  @@index([modelId])
  @@index([managerId])
  @@index([status])
}

enum ContractStatus {
  PENDING
  SIGNED
  REJECTED
}
```

### API Endpoints

The contract system provides the following tRPC procedures:

1. **createContract** (Manager only)
   - Creates a new contract for a model to sign
   - Example payload:
   ```typescript
   {
     modelId: "model-user-id",
     managerId: "manager-user-id",
     documentUrl: "https://storage.example.com/contracts/agreement.pdf"
   }
   ```

2. **getContractsByModel**
   - Returns contracts associated with a model (with role-specific access control)
   - Supports filtering by status (PENDING, SIGNED, REJECTED)
   - Includes pagination

3. **getContract**
   - Retrieves details of a specific contract
   - Access restricted to the model, manager, or admin

4. **updateContractStatus**
   - Allows models to sign or reject contracts
   - Automatically sets `signedAt` timestamp when status changes to SIGNED
   - Example payload:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "contract-id",
     status: "SIGNED"
   }
   ```

5. **getContractsByManager**
   - Returns contracts created by a manager (manager/admin access only)
   - Supports filtering and pagination

### UI Flows

The contract system includes two main UI flows:

1. **Contract Creation (Manager)**
   - Located at `/onboarding/contract`
   - Features:
     - Model selection dropdown
     - Document upload with preview
     - Form validation with Zod schemas
     - Success confirmation

2. **Contract Signing (Model)**
   - Located at `/onboarding/contract/sign/[id]`
   - Features:
     - Multi-step interface (Review ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Confirmation)
     - Document preview in iframe
     - Signature confirmation with legal acknowledgment
     - Timestamp display after signing

### Security & Permissions

- Contracts are accessible only to the involved parties (model and manager) and administrators
- Only models can sign or reject their own contracts
- Managers can only create contracts where they are the manager
- Once signed or rejected, contracts cannot be modified except by administrators
- All contract operations are timestamped for audit purposes

### Testing

The contract system includes comprehensive testing:
- Unit tests for Zod schemas
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for UI flows
- Timestamp verification for signed contracts

## Platform Access

### Overview

The Platform Access feature allows managers to control which social media platforms models can access and use. This ensures appropriate oversight while giving models the flexibility they need to manage their content across approved platforms.

### For Managers

Managers can control platform access through the Platform Access Management interface:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Admin > Platform Access**
2. Select a model from the list on the left
3. For each platform, toggle the switch to grant or revoke access
4. Use the "Initialize Access" button to set up access records for all platforms for a new model

![Platform Access Management](https://example.com/images/platform-access-management.png)

Key features for managers:
- Granular control over which platforms each model can access
- Ability to quickly set up or revoke access
- Clear overview of all platforms associated with each model

### For Models

Models will only see and be able to use platforms that have been approved by their managers:

1. Models can view their approved platforms in **Dashboard > Platforms**
2. When scheduling posts, only approved platforms will appear in the platform selector
3. If a model needs access to additional platforms, they should contact their manager

![Model Platform View](https://example.com/images/model-platforms-view.png)

### Integration with Scheduler

The platform access controls are fully integrated with the post scheduler:

1. When models create new posts, they can only select from their approved platforms
2. Attempts to schedule posts to unapproved platforms will be blocked by the API
3. This ensures consistent access control across the entire application

![Scheduler Platform Selection](https://example.com/images/scheduler-platform-selection.png)

### Security Considerations

- Access controls are enforced at both UI and API levels
- API endpoints validate that models only access approved platforms
- All platform access changes are logged for audit purposes
