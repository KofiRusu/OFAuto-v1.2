## Performance Results by Endpoint

### HTTP Response Time (ms)

| Endpoint | Min | Avg | Median | P90 | P95 | P99 | Max | Status |
|----------|-----|-----|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| /health | 32 | 87 | 78 | 155 | 187 | 222 | 356 | ✅ PASS |
| /scheduledPost (GET) | 128 | 253 | 231 | 412 | 487 | 612 | 1205 | ✅ PASS |
| /scheduledPost (POST) | 156 | 342 | 315 | 583 | 673 | 856 | 1402 | ✅ PASS |
| /automation (GET) | 105 | 187 | 172 | 289 | 348 | 524 | 978 | ✅ PASS |
| /automation (POST) | 142 | 378 | 352 | 618 | 694 | 897 | 1523 | ✅ PASS |

### Request Throughput

| Endpoint | Requests | Requests/s | % of Total |
|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| /health | 1,175 | 19.58 | 33.33% |
| /scheduledPost (GET) | 587 | 9.78 | 16.67% |
| /scheduledPost (POST) | 587 | 9.78 | 16.67% |
| /automation (GET) | 587 | 9.78 | 16.67% |
| /automation (POST) | 587 | 9.78 | 16.67% |

## Issues Identified

### 1. High Response Time Spikes (Medium Severity)

**Description**: Occasional response time spikes were observed during high concurrency periods, particularly for POST operations.

**Details**:
- Maximum response time for `/automation` POST reached 1523ms
- Maximum response time for `/scheduledPost` POST reached 1402ms

**Recommendation**: Implement caching for GET requests and optimize database queries to reduce response times during peak loads.

### 2. Connection Pool Saturation (Medium Severity)

**Description**: Database connection pool neared saturation (85% utilization) during peak load periods.

**Recommendation**: Increase connection pool size or implement a connection pool management strategy to better handle concurrent requests.

### 3. Memory Usage Growth (Low Severity)

**Description**: Memory usage showed a steady increase during the test, though it remained within acceptable limits.

**Details**:
- Starting heap usage: 286MB
- Ending heap usage: 402MB
- Growth rate: ~1.9MB/second

**Recommendation**: Investigate potential memory leaks, particularly in the automation and scheduled posting logic, and implement a monitoring alert for heap usage.

### 4. Batch Processing Opportunities (Low Severity)

**Description**: Multiple small database queries are being made instead of batch operations, particularly for scheduled post retrieval.

**Recommendation**: Implement batch processing and pagination for large result sets to reduce database load.

## Successful Thresholds

All defined thresholds passed:
- Error rate: 3.12% (threshold: <5%)
- HTTP request duration (p95): All endpoints below specified thresholds
- HTTP failure rate: 3.12% (threshold: <5%)

## Next Steps

1. Address the medium-severity issues before production release
2. Implement monitoring dashboards for the identified performance metrics
3. Add automated load testing to the CI/CD pipeline
4. Re-test with double the current load (100 VUs) to validate scalability
