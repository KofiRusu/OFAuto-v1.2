# Database Setup Summary

This file summarizes the steps attempted to set up the PostgreSQL database for OFAuto.

## Steps Attempted:

1.  **Docker Compose File:** A `docker-compose.yml` file was created in the `ofauto` directory to define a `postgres:15` service named `ofauto_db`.
    *   Database Name: `ofauto`
    *   User: `ofauto_user`
    *   Password: `very_strong_password123!` (Placeholder - **CHANGE THIS**)
    *   Host Port: `5433` (mapped to container port `5432`)

2.  **Docker Container Start:** An attempt was made to start the container using `docker compose up -d`. **This step failed** with exit code 137 (SIGKILL), likely due to resource constraints or Docker issues on the host machine.

3.  **Environment Configuration (`.env.local`):** The `.env.local` file was updated with the `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the intended Docker container:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://ofauto_user:very_strong_password123!@localhost:5433/ofauto"
    ```
    A placeholder `COOKIE_SECRET` was also added.

4.  **Prisma Migration:** An attempt was made to apply the database schema using `pnpm prisma migrate dev`. **This step failed** due to a `corepack` signature verification error, preventing `pnpm` from running.

## ⚠️ Current Status & Next Steps

*   **BLOCKER:** The primary issue is the `corepack` error preventing `pnpm` commands (including `prisma migrate`) from executing. This needs to be resolved first.
    *   **Recommended Fix:** Try disabling corepack (`corepack disable` in your terminal) and ensure `pnpm` is installed globally (`npm install -g pnpm`). Then retry the `pnpm prisma migrate dev` command.
    *   See previous chat message for other potential Corepack fixes (Node update, network check).
*   **Docker Container:** The database container may not be running due to the earlier `docker compose up` failure. After resolving the Corepack issue, you may need to run `docker compose up -d` again successfully.
*   **Password:** The placeholder password `very_strong_password123!` in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.local` **must** be changed to a secure, unique password for any real deployment.
*   **Cookie Secret:** The placeholder `COOKIE_SECRET` in `.env.local` **must** be replaced with a long, random string (e.g., generated using `openssl rand -base64 32`).

Once the Corepack issue is fixed and the Docker container is confirmed running, the `pnpm prisma migrate dev` command should succeed, creating the necessary database tables.
