# OFAuto Incident Response Procedure

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures to follow in case of a production incident. It serves as a guide for on-call engineers and support staff to ensure a quick, efficient response to any issues that may arise.

## Incident Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| P0 | **Critical Outage**: Service is completely down or unusable for all users. | Immediate (24/7) | - Database failure<br>- Complete API outage<br>- Security breach |
| P1 | **Severe Impact**: Major functionality is impaired for many users. | Within 1 hour (24/7) | - Scheduled posts not being published<br>- Authentication issues<br>- Payment processing failures |
| P2 | **Moderate Impact**: Non-critical feature unavailable or degraded. | Within 4 hours (business hours) | - Analytics delays<br>- UI display issues<br>- Slow response times |
| P3 | **Minor Impact**: Cosmetic issues or minor bugs affecting few users. | Next business day | - Styling issues<br>- Non-critical feature bugs<br>- Documentation errors |

## On-Call Schedule

- **Primary**: First responder to any incident alerts
- **Secondary**: Backup if primary is unavailable
- **Engineering Manager**: Escalation point for P0/P1 incidents
- **Domain Expert**: Called based on the specific system affected

## Incident Detection

Incidents may be detected through:

1. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - Datadog alerts
   - CloudWatch alarms
   - PagerDuty notifications
   - Error rate thresholds

2. **User Reports**:
   - Support tickets
   - Direct communication
   - Social media mentions

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Acknowledge (First 5 minutes)

- Acknowledge the alert in PagerDuty
- Join the incident-specific Slack channel
- Announce that you're investigating the issue
- Make an initial assessment of severity

### 2. Investigate (Next 10-30 minutes)

- Check monitoring dashboards
- Review recent deployment changes
- Check error logs and metrics
- Determine the scope of impact
- Identify potential causes

### 3. Mitigate (As soon as possible)

- Apply immediate fixes if possible
- Consider rollback if related to recent deployment
- Implement temporary workarounds if needed
- Communicate status to stakeholders

### 4. Resolve

- Implement permanent fix
- Verify the fix works across all systems
- Restore any degraded services
- Update status page and notify users

### 5. Post-Incident (Within 48 hours)

- Conduct a blameless post-mortem
- Document root cause and resolution
- Identify preventative measures
- Implement changes to avoid future occurrences

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication

- Use the #incident-response Slack channel
- Update status every 30 minutes for P0/P1
- Tag relevant team members as needed
- Document actions taken in real time

### External Communication

- Update status page for user-facing issues
- Prepare customer communications for:
  - Issue acknowledgment
  - ETA for resolution
  - Resolution confirmation
- Coordinate messaging with support team

## Emergency Procedures

### Database Failure

1. Check RDS monitoring dashboard
2. Verify Multi-AZ failover status
3. If not automatically resolved, manually trigger failover
4. Monitor recovery progress

### API Outage

1. Check ECS service status
2. Review ALB health checks and target groups
3. Verify auto-scaling configuration
4. Check for recent API code changes
5. Scale up instances if needed

### Security Incident

1. Immediately notify security team
2. Preserve evidence and logs
3. Consider temporary service restriction
4. Follow security breach protocol document

## Failover Testing Results

Recent RDS Multi-AZ failover test conducted on May 3, 2025 showed:
- Failover trigger to completion: 1m47s
- Application recovery: 2m12s
- Total downtime: 3m59s

## Rollback Procedures

### Code Rollback

```bash
# 1. Identify the previous stable release tag
git checkout production-release-1.2.3

# 2. Push to production branch
git push origin HEAD:production -f

# 3. Monitor deployment in GitHub Actions
# 4. Verify critical endpoints after deployment
```

### Database Rollback

1. Access AWS RDS console
2. Select the appropriate snapshot from before the incident
3. Restore to a new instance
4. Verify data integrity
5. Swap the endpoint configuration
