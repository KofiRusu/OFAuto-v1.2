# OFAuto System Deployment Task

## Objective
Full deployment of the OFAuto content management and automation platform on Git using Docker, ensuring all tests pass successfully.

## Project Overview
OFAuto is a comprehensive platform designed for content creators across multiple platforms with a focus on subscription-based services. The system integrates with various social media and creator platforms, providing a unified dashboard for content publishing, engagement metrics, financial tracking, and personalized insights.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js 14, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Testing**: Jest, Puppeteer, Lighthouse CI
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry, Winston

## Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Clone the repository and set up the development environment
- [ ] Configure environment variables following `.env.example`
- [ ] Set up local database using `npm run db:init`
- [ ] Verify local development server runs correctly with `npm run dev`

### 2. Docker Configuration Review
- [ ] Review existing Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Identify and fix any issues in the Docker configuration
- [ ] Test multi-container setup with database and Redis
- [ ] Optimize Docker image size and build process

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
- [ ] Implement GitHub Actions workflow for:
  - [ ] Code linting and type checking
  - [ ] Unit and integration testing
  - [ ] Docker image building and pushing
  - [ ] Deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Set up deployment approvals for production

### 4. Frontend Optimizations
- [ ] Implement code splitting for improved loading times
- [ ] Add lazy loading for images and heavy components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size using the built-in analyzer
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
- [ ] Fix any accessibility issues identified by axe-core tests

### 5. Network Configuration
- [ ] Set up secure HTTPS configuration
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Set up a CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement network-level security best practices

### 6. Load Testing and Performance
- [ ] Run and analyze existing load tests (using k6)
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Suggest and implement optimizations
- [ ] Document performance baseline and improvements

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Ensure all Jest tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Run and pass Lighthouse CI tests (`npm run test:lighthouse`)
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance (`npm run test:a11y`)
- [ ] Complete smoke tests for critical application paths
- [ ] Fix any failing tests

## Deliverables
1. Fully functional local development environment
2. Optimized Docker configuration
3. Working CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
4. Passing tests (unit, integration, accessibility, performance)
5. Documentation of your changes and optimizations
6. Performance testing results and analysis

## Evaluation Criteria
- All tests passing in the CI pipeline
- Docker containers starting and functioning properly
- Code quality and adherence to project standards
- Performance improvements documented
- Security best practices followed
