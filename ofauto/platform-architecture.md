# AI Strategy System â€“ Development Checkpoint

## Overview
The AI Strategy System is a modular, extensible component of the OnlyFans Management Platform that provides context-aware, LLM-generated revenue strategies for creators and clients. It leverages analytics data, GPT-4 Turbo, and a custom scoring engine to surface ranked strategic actions across pricing, content, engagement, and growth domains.

## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. **OpenAI Integration**
- Created `OpenAIService` with GPT-4 Turbo.
- Added rate limiting, API error handling, and fallback logic.
- Integrated analytics data into prompt generation for personalized outputs.
- AI outputs are validated, parsed, and formatted before insertion.

### 2. **Scoring System**
- Built `ScoringService` with:
  - ROI estimation (revenue uplift vs implementation complexity).
  - Weighted formula based on performance, growth, ease-of-action.
  - Normalization for score consistency across clients and strategy types.
- Generated insights for each recommendation alongside score.

### 3. **Strategy Service**
- Unified core logic into `StrategyService` singleton.
- Added:
  - `generateStrategy()`
  - `scoreStrategy()`
  - `fetchInsightsForStrategy()`
- Automatically stores OpenAI output, score, metadata, and timestamped context.

### 4. **UI Enhancements**
- StrategyManager:
  - Card-based layout with type filters
  - Expanded view with ROI breakdown + insight summaries
- Status updates (Draft, Implemented, Skipped)
- Visual ROI badge + hover-to-explain insights

## ðŸš€ Next Opportunities
- Add new strategy types:
  - `RETENTION`
  - `CROSS_PROMOTION`
  - `MESSAGE_TEMPLATES`
- Enhance scoring with historical conversion tracking
- Compare multiple strategies side-by-side (score vs expected outcome)
- Enable feedback loop for improving suggestion quality (like/dislike training)

## Dev Notes
- All tRPC procedures are RBAC-guarded
- Strategy generation uses real analytics data from the Reporting system
- Can support both OpenAI and Anthropic providers (future dual LLM logic)
